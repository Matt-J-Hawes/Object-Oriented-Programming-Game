I personalised the following things to suit my 'movie themed' version of this app:

- Backround Image - camera stock photo

- Changed colour scheme to #9370DB (purple) for correct answers, hearts and player name AND #7F0000 (red) for incorrect answers

- Added compulsory player name selection in order to personalise the message on the wining/losing screen. 

- Added hover states to 'Start Button' and 'Keyboard Keys' - increasing its size and visability.

- Added an aditional subheading of 'Movie Edition'

- Changed 'Lose Heart' image to blackout
